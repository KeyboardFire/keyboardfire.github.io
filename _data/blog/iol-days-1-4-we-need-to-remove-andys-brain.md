title: IOL, days 1-4: We need to remove Andy's brain
-->
I'm going to the International Linguistics Olympiad! So I figured I'd document what happens along the way.

[The IOL](http://ioling.org/) is a competition attended by nations all over the
world (this year, 40 teams from 29 countries) that tests the contestants'
skills of, to quote their official website, "*logical ability, patient work,
and willingness to think around corners*." Having somehow managed to do well
enough in [the North American Computational Linguistics
Olympiad](http://nacloweb.org/) to get on the US team, I now get to push my
luck even further at Dublin, the site of this year's IOL.

But first, the US and Canada teams flew to Boston and met at MIT for a few days
of practice together. (We'd been doing practices over Skype, but we'd never
actually all been in the same place.) The airline somehow managed to lose my
bag on a direct flight and take multiple days to return it (one of the coaches
claims that there's a tradition that people who lose their bags tend to become
IOL winners, which I can only hope continues), but other than that everything
went fairly smoothly.

When we arrived at MIT, we fittingly spent a lot of time in the linguistics and
philosophy department. In fact, we were in the very department that contained
Chomsky's office:

Sadly, he wasn't around to see us.

We also found this sculpture, which we thought aptly suited the occasion:

[![MIT symbols and numbers sculpture](/s/iol/2.jpg)](/s/iol/2.jpg)

We spent a large portion of our time at MIT listening to various presentations
about linguistics, ranging from computational linguistics and neural networks
to phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Some were given by professors
at MIT, some by our coaches, and all of them were decidedly fascinating.

A few of us also went on a sightseeing trip around Boston led by one of our
coaches:

The trip involved crossing Harvard Bridge ("it's called Harvard Bridge because
no MIT students would build such an ugly bridge," according to a coach), with
its idiosyncratic unit of measurement:

After crossing the bridge, we went on to visit Boston Common:

Other than the talks and the sightseeing, we played some board and card games
and also did a full IOL team problem in our actual teams as practice. The one
we did was [2011, Sanskrit Poetry](http://www.ioling.org/problems/2011/), which
was... an unusual one, to say the least. (Of course, it helped that one of the
prior lectures was dedicated entirely to poetry.) In the case of USA Red, we
learned that we are apparently incapable of counting; the problem requested
that we name syllables by number, and it took a worryingly long time for us to
finally settle on whether a certain syllable was the eighth or ninth one.

We got our t-shirts, too!

This was my design, although it went through about a hundred iterations before
approaching anything near something decent. Here's the team blue shirt, except
as the original design instead of an extremely low quality picture:

Some other highlights:

**Coach**: "I'm passing around this IPA chart, so if you want anything from CVS
just write it on the back."

**One of my teammates**: "We need to remove Andy's brain."

(This was during a game of [Fluxx](http://www.looneylabs.com/games/fluxx), at a
point where the goal was to obtain the brain card as well as another card, and
I had the brain card.)

**Coach**: "Undergrads talking to graduate students talking to professors...
it's like a multilayer network."  
**Some people**: *(turn to look at him)*  
**Coach**: "And then there's backpropogation."  
**More people**: *(turn and look)*  
**Coach**: "It's called [graduate student descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)."  
**Everyone**: *(bursts out laughing)*

(For context, this is the same coach who gave us a presentation about neural
networks the day before.)

**Airport employee**: "So, what sport do you all play?"

**Coach's daughter**: "I want to take a picture of that sign, but I'm literally
not allowed to."

(This is referring to one of the first Irish words we saw upon arriving in
Dublin. It was a sign that said "No photography," and the Irish translation was
"Cosc ar ghrianghrafad√≥ireacht.")

I'll leave you with this mysteriously flat building we passed on the way to the
airport:

Tomorrow is the first actual day of the IOL, its main highlight being the
opening ceremony. I'm writing this right before we have dinner with all the
other teams that have arrived so far. We've met Team Sweden already, since they
came from the airport with us (effortlessly switching between Swedish and
English, of course, much to my monolingual chagrin), and as mentioned we've
been working with Team Canada. But in general, I'm feeling both incredibly
excited for IOL and incredibly terrified at actually participating in it!
