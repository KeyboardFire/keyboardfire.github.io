<h3 id='c'>C/C++</h3>

<ul class='par'>
    <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/cfractal'>cfractal</a></strong> is a program I wrote for <a href='https://codeday.org/'>CodeDay</a> Houston in winter of 2015 with <a href='https://github.com/mobby12345/'>one of my friends</a>. It won one of the four awards given out at the end of the event. cfractal generates beautiful <a href='http://flam3.com/flame.pdf'>fractal flames</a>; here's one of my favorites:<br><br><img src='fractal.png' alt='Fractal flame' width='100%'></li>
    <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/caveman-duels'>caveman-duels</a></strong> was written for <a href='http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/34968/3808'>a King of the Hill programming contest on Stack Exchange</a>, which had over 50 participants. Aside from having fun, I learned a lot about C++ from writing it!</li>
    <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/snowman-lang'>snowman</a></strong> is an <a href='http://esolangs.org'>esoteric programming language</a>. Again, it was both fun to work on and taught me many things about C++. Here's an example Snowman program (it does ROT13 on its input):
    <pre>}vg:*#96nG|#110nL,bO|#64nG'(#78nL('&gt;<br>bO,oR|:#13nA;:#109nG|#123nL,bO|#77nG<br>'(#91nL('&gt;bO,oR|:#13nS;:#;bI;bI;aMsP</pre>
    Needless to say, readability was not a primary design goal. (In fact, being as confusing and unreadable as possible was a major objective.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='ruby'>Ruby</h3>

<ul class='par'>
    <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/i3bang'>i3bang</a></strong> is a preprocessor for i3 config files, which are traditionally very verbose and repetitive (in an attempt to remain both flexible and easy to understand). I wrote i3bang with the goal of preserving those qualities while cutting down on some of the cruft, and I and several others have found it helpful (airblader himself called it "insanely cool," which I'm pretty proud of :)).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='python'>Python</h3>

<ul class='par'>
    <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/ascii-gallows-club'>ascii-gallows-club</a></strong> and <strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/ascii-checkers-club'>ascii-checkers-club</a></strong> were pretty much my first experience with working on a project as a team. They were both written in Python by me and three other people.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='rust'>Rust</h3>

<ul class='par'>
    <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/kfp'>kfp</a></strong> is what this website runs on. It was the topic of <a href='/blog/code/on-the-merits-of-roll-your-own-blog-engine.html'>my first blog post</a>.</li>
    <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/rustyham'>rustyham</a></strong> is a Hamming code generator in Rust. I wrote rustyham primarily to see what it's like to work with a project complete with tests with Travis CI integration, put on a package manager, etc., but it's also (AFAIK) the first Hamming code program to be <a href='https://crates.io/crates/rustyham'>published on crates.io</a>, where it has &gt;300 downloads.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='javascript'>JavaScript</h3>

<ul class='par'>
    <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/stackexchange-chatception'>chatception</a></strong> and <strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/sevichat'>sevichat</a></strong> are two userscripts for Stack Exchange chat that I and others find immensely useful.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='web'>web design</h3>

<ul class='par'>
    <li><strong>This website</strong> was hand-coded by me. :)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='shell'>shell</h3>

<ul class='par'>
    <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/mkcast'>mkcast</a></strong> is a tool for creating GIF screencats of a terminal, with key presses overlaid. It got posted on Reddit and Hacker News and ended up getting over 3,300 stars on GitHub. But it's basically held together by terrible hacks, so I later made <strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/xscast'>xscast</a></strong> which does the same thing but far better.</li>
</ul>
