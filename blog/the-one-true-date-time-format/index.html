            title: The One True Date/Time Format
            -->
            
            <p>Everybody I meet seems to have a different way of writing down dates and times. Of the myriad of possibilities, to me, there&#39;s one that makes the most sense.</p>
            
            <p>This is <strong>The One True Date/Time Format</strong>:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
            <p>2016-08-13 19:45:28</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>That is, the year, month, and then day separated by dashes, then the hour (in
            24-hour time), minute, and second separated by colons, with everything except
            the year zero-padded to two digits. As noted by <a href="https://xkcd.com/1179/">the xkcd comic on date
            formatting</a>, this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO
            8601</a> standard. That&#39;s not the only
            advantage it has, though.</p>
            
            <p>Firstly, the order of each date element makes intuitive sense. Starting with
            the longest time period (year), the numbers are listed in order by the
            magnitude of the amounts of time they represent, all the way down to seconds.
            The month/day/year format, common in the US, isn&#39;t ordered logically like this,
            but rather by how dates are spoken, which would only make sense if the date
            were written spelled out (&quot;September 13, 2016,&quot; not &quot;8/13/16&quot;).</p>
            
            <p>All numbers are also padded to two digits (except the year). Combined with the
            previous point, this means that dates and times in this format sort extremely
            nicely.  It&#39;s also—although this is completely a matter of personal
            opinion—more aesthetically pleasing; I&#39;ve always found &quot;12/4/2015&quot; to be quite
            ugly and asymmetrical.</p>
            
            <p>As for the separators, the hyphen has the marginal advantage that it can be
            used in file names and can&#39;t possibly be confused for the number 1. Since the
            ISO standard also specifies hyphens as separators, with slashes being used for
            date ranges, I prefer to use hyphens over slashes (or dots).</p>
            
            <p>24-hour time makes a lot more sense than 12-hour time. It gets rid of
            confusion/ambiguity, it&#39;s more compact, it doesn&#39;t arbitrarily divide the day
            at some irrelevant point, and it&#39;s consistent with how dates work (imagine if
            we wrote dates differently depending on whether they were in the first or
            second half of the year!).</p>
            
            <p>Obviously, I can&#39;t convince everybody to switch to this format. But I can at
            least outline my reasons for using it, and hopefully persuade a few people.</p>
