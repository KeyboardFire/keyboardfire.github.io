            title: On the merits of "roll your own blog engine"
            -->
            
            <p>This blog, along with the rest of my website, runs on a (currently, as of 1st draft) <a href="https://github.com/KeyboardFire/kfp/tree/f20718fc5db49fdaf38b02e8263d37aba00de2c8">214 SLOC</a> Rust backend. So my first blog post might as well be an explanation of why I chose to do it this way.</p>
            
            <p>Of course, building a blog engine / CMS from scratch is an oft-ridiculed
            endeavor. Don&#39;t reinvent the wheel, it&#39;s a waste of time, people have already
            done it far better than you ever can, etc. There&#39;s even this quote from Jeff
            Atwood, cofounder of Stack Exchange, creator of Discourse, and blogger on
            <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a>:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
            <p>Although I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve been sorely tempted myself, I wonder if writing your
            own blog software isn&#39;t a form of procrastination in and of itself.</p>
            
            <p><sub>(<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/on-frameworkitis/">source</a>)</sub></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>So why <em>did</em> I resolve to create the tentatively-named <code>kfp</code>, &quot;KeyboardFire
            preprocessor&quot;?</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><p><strong>It&#39;s seamless.</strong> I had previously tried both Wordpress and
            <a href="http://dropplets.com/">Dropplets</a>, and while I could wrestle with them both
            to get them to look <em>somewhat</em> like the rest of my website, they were by no
            means perfect. By necessity, my blog has always looked significantly
            different than the remainder of my hand-coded site.</p>
            
            <p>With an integrated solution, that&#39;s no longer the case. The way I&#39;ve
            structured <code>kfp</code>, it allows me to simply use the same <code>TEMPLATE.html</code> for
            both the blog and any other page. This lets me achieve a flawless
            continuity throughout my website, even in the source code: I&#39;ve added the
            extra touch of adapting to indentation level so that the HTML source code
            could even theoretically be believed to have been written by hand, should
            one not know better.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Infinite customizability.</strong> Since <code>kfp</code> is strictly a <em>single-purpose</em>
            program, I&#39;m not restricted to generalizations that platforms like Wordpress
            have to make in order to be usable by millions of people. Sure, I can patch
            the Wordpress source code, but naturally the codebase is <em>gigantic</em>, and I
            don&#39;t have the huge advantage of knowing the source code like the back of my
            hand, so thoroughly that I might have written it myself....</p>
            
            <p>As an example, take Markdown. <code>kfp</code> automagically renders <code>.md</code> blog posts
            written in Markdown format (with a short metadata block at the top) into
            HTML because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> is
            substantially easier to write in than raw HTML. However, different Markdown
            renderers can have slightly different behavior; some have custom features
            such as footnotes, for instance. With a blog engine written from scratch, I
            can customize my markdown renderer without limitation. I can use <em>any</em>
            external renderer written in <em>any</em> languageâ€”I can even add my own
            specially-made features.</p>
            
            <p>Another more important example is how it works server-side. Wordpress runs
            on PHP, which means it requires the web host to support PHP in order to
            work. Since I&#39;m hosting my website on Github Pages, I only get to serve
            static HTML. So instead of dynamically running code every time a user
            requests a page, I simply manually run <code>kfp</code> on my own machine and then
            push to Github. This way, all files served to the client are static HTML.
            <code>kfp</code> is also not dependent on any specific PHP version or anything of the
            like; it&#39;ll continue to work regardless of which webhost I&#39;m using.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Avoided complexity.</strong> As I mentioned in the previous point, Wordpress has
            the extra burden of catering to millions of people with thousands of
            different use cases. <code>kfp</code> is 214 lines of source code. Speaks for itself,
            really.</p>
            
            <p>And yes, yes, I don&#39;t have to use all of Wordpress&#39;s features, and disk
            space is cheap, and it&#39;s really not that big of a deal. But it&#39;s simply an
            extra perk, another benefit that I can get from going about things this
            way.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>For practice!</strong> I&#39;ve learned a lot about Rust from writing <code>kfp</code>. As
            always, the best way to learn a new programming language is to just make
            stuff in it, and writing <code>kfp</code> with best practices in mind has taught me a
            lot. It&#39;s surprisingly fun, too.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I&#39;m pretty happy with the way <code>kfp</code> and the newest (and hopefully last)
            iteration of my website design have turned out. Although, I must confess...
            Jeff Atwood&#39;s quote about procrastination rings a lot truer than I&#39;ve been
            indicating. ;)</p>
