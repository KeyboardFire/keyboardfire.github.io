            <p>Two weeks ago, my friends and I were talking with each other (online, which as
            a side effect created a record of all that was said), and the topic of finals
            came up. One of my friends mentioned their apprehension for their math final,
            citing the amount of memorization required. As is typical for the group of
            friends in question, this resulted in an hour-long discussion/debate which I
            think is worth preserving elsewhere, rather than being forever relegated to the
            history of the online group.</p>
            
            <p>The friend (who will remain unnamed for anonymity purposes) had an aversion to
            trigonometry in particular, and went on to explain their system for memorizing
            the signs of trigonometric functions. As it turned out, a number of people had
            similar methods, all of which were some variant of an acronym for &quot;ASTC&quot;—all
            positive in quadrant I, sine positive in quadrant II, tangent in III, and
            cosine in IV.</p>
            
            <p>Having never heard of this acronym, my immediate reaction was, and I quote:
            &quot;that&#39;s stupid and bad.&quot;</p>
            
            <p>If you&#39;ve known me for a long enough time, then you certainly also know that I
            have some rather strong opinions on how math should be taught. And this... this
            <em>abomination</em> was the very epitome of everything I had against the current
            state of math education! (Sidenote: if you haven&#39;t known me well enough, you&#39;re
            about to become very well acquainted with the burning hatred I have for
            learning and teaching math poorly.)</p>
            
            <p>I tried to explain an intuitive method for achieving the same task through an
            extremely poorly drawn diagram. For those following along with the actual math,
            it was something like this:</p>
            
            <p><img src='/s/astc.png'></p>
            
            <p>From this point on, it&#39;s going to be easier to write commentary on the ensuing
            discussion, which will remain unedited save for names in the interests of
            accuracy.</p>
            
            <table>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>it literally takes like 2 seconds of thought</td></tr>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>i bet i can say astc in faster than 2 seconds</td></tr>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>its already engrained into my mind</td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>This is exactly the mindset that I find actively harmful to actually learning
            math. The response after I asked what people hoped to achieve by memorizing
            things like this that don&#39;t actually help anyone learn anything was:</p>
            
            <table>
            <tr class=B><td>B</td><td>Grades</td></tr>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>i understand exactly why they are what they are</td></tr>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>but its faster not to do that on a test</td></tr>
            <tr><td colspan=2 style='text-align: left;'>[...]</td></tr>
            <tr class=B><td>B</td><td>I mean he's not wrong</td></tr>
            <tr class=B><td>B</td><td>I also learned the acronym</td></tr>
            <tr class=B><td>B</td><td>I know how the math works</td></tr>
            <tr class=B><td>B</td><td>and don't really bother with it</td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>Now, this really bothers me. The issues with the math curriculum are an
            entirely different rant, but the way the school system works is partially to
            blame here, and I&#39;ve only rarely ever seen a (middle school / high school
            level) course that fully addresses the issue of memorization&#39;s being the
            optimal &quot;strategy&quot; for students for whom grades are all that matter. By no
            means do I imply that doing so is nontrivial or even easy, but I do think that
            schools and teachers should certainly put more focus into fixing this problem.</p>
            
            <table>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>if you don't have good mathematical intuition</td></tr>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>this is something that can easily be learned and understood</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>no it can't</td></tr>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>it doesn't rely on "intuition"</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>it's really hard to get good mathematical intuition</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>like you can teach the individual case easily</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>but I bet there are tons of these things that would bother you that you just don't know about</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>and the solution isn't to teach them the individual case</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>it's to try to develop the thinking skills that make them do this on their own</td></tr>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>that is what I am attempting to achieve by yelling at A (sorry A if you feel like you are the sole target of my anger, which just exists in general :P)</td></tr>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>he clearly knows how triangles work</td></tr>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>he is just opting to memorize the acronym instead of using that knowledge</td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>C&#39;s point, which I agree with in retrospect, was that schools should teach
            students how to use their existing knowledge to figure out new concepts rather
            than teaching rules to memorize such as the one that started this discussion.
            While I am in complete agreement, I also think the students have a part here as
            well. A math student has to be willing to take this extra step; math students
            must challenge the reasoning behind what they know. The teacher holds some
            responsibility for teaching &quot;shortcuts&quot; instead of concepts and ideas, but it
            is also partially the students&#39; responsibility to ask themselves if they can
            explain why a certain fact is true. If they can&#39;t, if they don&#39;t have a solid
            mental model of how what they know actually works, all of their higher level
            knowledge will be brittle and lack foundation.</p>
            
            <table>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>becaues it is faster!</td></tr>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>i just dont see the problem if i understand the derivation</td></tr>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>and if its faster for me</td></tr>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>should i be trying to do it the "right way" if it takes longer for me? not on a test</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>not for him</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>or for me</td></tr>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>but for me</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>yeah and that's the issue I would want to fix</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>the acronyms are faster for you because you don't have properly developed mathematical intuition</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>sorry</td></tr>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>well ok, you're blaming the school system for this and it's maybe partially that but I also think if you were willing to try it, you would find that it really doesn't take as much longer as you think or even longer at all</td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>Again, the issue with the math class itself here is that it rewards &quot;I can do
            this fast&quot; over &quot;I can understand what I&#39;m doing,&quot; which is not an easy problem
            to solve but most definitely a solvable problem. Teachers should ensure that
            students know where the facts come from, not just that they can memorize the
            facts. Tests should consist of subjectively graded, open-ended questions such
            as derivations, not questions that only determine whether the test-taker can
            arrive at the right answer. From personal experience, some students&#39; obsession
            with only knowing the right answer, regardless of how it might have been
            arrived at, is already bad enough.</p>
            
            <table>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>it's easy for you because you can see problems and kinda see what the answers are going to be like</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>which makes it so that you don't usually make big mistakes</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>whereas that might now be the case for others</td></tr>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>I maintain this isn't a case of lack of intuition, it's lack of willingness to use it</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>hmm</td></tr>
            <tr class=C><td>C</td><td>but it's less accurate/quick for him</td></tr>
            <tr class=B><td>B</td><td>I think it's he understands why it works but it still takes him longer to get to the logic than just acronym it</td></tr>
            <tr class=B><td>B</td><td>Which is clearly a lack of intuition</td></tr>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>what no, if he's capable of getting to the logic then he has the intuition</td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>&quot;I memorize things because I can&#39;t do it any other way&quot; is, I think, an
            entirely counterproductive attitude. So many people to whom I&#39;ve tried to
            explain some concept have given up despite clearly being capable of
            understanding it simply because they&#39;ve convinced themselves that they&#39;re not.
            Nobody understands everything immediately upon seeing it, and nobody is totally
            incapable of understanding anything either. I believe that there is no
            &quot;maximum&quot; amount that a given student can learn, but memorizing shortcuts
            instead of learning concepts will only take away underlying and necessary
            understanding for the future.</p>
            
            <table>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>and if i ever falter i know that that can be used and probably will use it because that is what i have been taught to do rather than think about the graph of sin or the unit circle</td></tr>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>I would rather rely on logical steps that I can clearly see to be right, than rely on my memorization and hoping that I remembered some random letters correctly</td></tr>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>but the more important thing imo is it got us to the same point</td></tr>
            <tr class=A><td>A</td><td>where its now 95% of the time instantaneous</td></tr>
            <tr class=me><td>me</td><td>the end result is not indicative of the methods used to get to it... do you expect to remember astscttswhatever for the rest of your life? is solving every problem like that not absurdly unsustainable? how can you be sure that you're really learning?</td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>Let&#39;s say I want to draw a picture. This picture has a dog, so I buy a
            dog-shaped stamp and use it to stamp a dog onto the paper. Later, I need to
            draw a cat and a rabbit too, so I go buy two more stamps. Soon enough, I end up
            with a mountain of stamps when a simple pencil would suffice if I just learned
            how to draw these things. And what if I want to draw a dog with two tails
            (adapt a concept for another use, following along with the reality
            corresponding to the analogy)? Or just the head of the cat? Memorizing the
            solution to a problem means failing to be able to break it down into its key
            parts, a crucial skill for any type of problem solving.</p>
            
            <table>

            <p>Understanding fosters more understanding, and lack of it perpetuates. Math is
            innately cumulative in nature, so if you can&#39;t prove where one thing comes
            from, everything that builds on it is in turn baseless. Even if you understand
            steps 1 through 200, if you don&#39;t get step 201, then there&#39;s no way you&#39;ll
            fully understand steps 202 through 5000 without deliberately making the effort
            to grasp that 201st step. And by the same token, if you can&#39;t tell when you
            mess up a basic concept, then you&#39;ll certainly be lost when you mess up
            something that&#39;s built 10 levels on top of that concept and have no idea what
            you&#39;ve done wrong.</p>

            <p>No, you&#39;re not learning about quadratic equations for the sole purpose of their
            being practically useful later in your life. And please don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re
            learning about them &quot;because they&#39;re gonna be on the test.&quot; The real reason
            you&#39;re in math class is to learn how to learn, so to speak. To quote Ben Orlin:
            &quot;Math is the playground of reason.&quot; Math class can teach you one of the most
            valuable skills in your life, even if you don&#39;t plan to study math at all after
            finishing high school: math teaches you how to think, how to extrapolate
            information from what you know, how to make logically sound conclusions. And
            memorizing mnemonics ruins all of that.</p>

            <p>This is the problem with extrinsic motivation. When students are motivated only
            by an external force such as grades, they are less invested, they start to care
            less. The impetus behind learning should be intrinsic motivation, where
            students learn not for any reward from some outside agent but because they
            genuinely want to learn. I&#39;m not trying to accuse anyone of not wanting to
            learn—everyone has some measure of intrinsic motivation. But when external
            factors start to compete with or even overcome internal factors in terms of a
            student&#39;s drive for learning, that student may begin to prioritize goals that

            <p>Yes. You are ultimately allowed to do whatever you want with your learning
            process, and at the end of the day I can do absolutely nothing to stop you. You
            might even get the same results as those you would get with a different, more
            effort-intensive method. And if the end result is all you care about and you
            simply won&#39;t be convinced otherwise, then I have nothing more to say. However,
            I sincerely hope that everyone reading this can find that spark of curiosity,
            that intellectual drive that serves as motivation to actually learn, standing
            in solidarity against all the external factors that tempt hapless students into
            relying on fragile and meaningless shortcuts.</p>

            <p>The conversation had basically ended at this point, so F&#39;s consideration was
            left mostly unconsidered. It&#39;s worth considering, though, so I&#39;ll do so now:
            yes, I acknowledge that rederiving formulae takes longer on tests, where time
            is of the utmost importance. However, for one thing, that 10 extra seconds
            really isn&#39;t going to make a tangible difference in the grand scheme of things,
            and additionally, if a student were to happen to forget one of the myriad
            shortcuts floating around in their flimsy, precarious web, the student who has
            not made provisions to build this information from scratch will be hopelessly
            lost. (And I say this last thing with my tongue firmly lodged in my cheek, so
            please don&#39;t murder me, actual teachers: you&#39;ll save time overall because
            you&#39;ll spend less studying!)</p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <p>Well, I&#39;ve ranted about a lot of different facets of things I find wrong with
            the current state of math education based on this one hour-long
            conversation/debate. I&#39;ve talked about the problems with the school system (or
            whatever nebulous entity that&#39;s supposed to refer to), about how some school
            environments condition students to optimize for speed rather than
            understanding, about the slew of outside factors that warp people&#39;s motivation
            for learning math, and about the reason we require everyone to take math
            classes in the first place.</p>
            
            <p>None of us can control any of these factors directly, but everyone—every last
            person in the world—has the capacity to care about math. To appreciate its
            beauty, to actually think for once. To make it a worthwhile endeavor, not some
            fuzzy pile of vague high school memories. To stop asking &quot;how,&quot; and start
            asking &quot;why.&quot; And not only that—everyone stands to benefit from caring about
            math. Telling someone that a square number can only have a remainder of 0, 1,
            or 4 when divided by 8 is one thing, but having people actually discover why on
            their own gives them an entirely different experience, an experience that
            develops problem solving skills and an &quot;intuition&quot; that can be applied
            virtually anywhere. Math class teaches math, but most importantly, math class
            teaches thinking. It&#39;s intended to push the boundaries of what we know.</p>
            
            <p>If math really is &quot;the playground of reason,&quot; then memorization is the
            stereotypically featureless detention room made for the singular purpose of
            boring the children confined to it. So go, play, explore, discover, learn. It&#39;s
            what the playground was built for.</p>
