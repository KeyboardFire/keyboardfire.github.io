            -->
            
            <p>The 2017 IOL individual contest has just ended! (See <a href="/blog/iol-days-1-4-we-need-to-remove-andys-brain/">part 1</a> and <a href="/blog/iol-day-4-hunting-hamilton/">part 2</a>.)</p>

            <p>Okay, so first, an important order of business to wrap up from the previous
            blog post. As mentioned, we would not let a closed train station stand in the
            way of our pilgrimage of sorts to Broom Bridge, where Hamilton famously carved
            the formula for quaternion multiplication after having had his flash of insight
            while crossing it. So after much convincing, we managed to get our coach to let
            a group of 4 of us (which later grew to 5) spend the afternoon (the day
            immediately before the individual contest, no less) going on a second journey
            into Dublin.</p>
            
            <p>It started off rainy, but the rain quickly cleared as we were walking to the
            bus stop. We actually had a plan this time, too, having found a bus route that
            would take us directly to the bridge. So we were feeling pretty confident until
            we realized we didn&#39;t bring enough money for the bus ride. After some
            deliberation, we managed to find an alternate route that would cost only 4 euro
            rather than 4.70, at the cost of having to walk for a bit to get to the bridge.</p>
            
            <p>When we finally arrived at the destination bus stop, we began walking towards
            the bridge and it of course immediately started raining again. This time it
            wasn&#39;t just some light rain like it was when we first left. A torrential
            downpour had appeared with no warning and quickly made it nearly impossible to
            see more than several feet ahead. (My shoes were still wet when I woke up the
            next day.)</p>
            
            <p>As we approached the bridge, the rain got lighter and lighter (as I suggested
            to the other four, &quot;I think we just passed Hamilton&#39;s test&quot;). Having proved
            ourselves worthy, we were rewarded by the sight of the bridge we had come so
            far to see directly ahead of us. And so, at last, we ran towards it...</p>
            
            <p><a href="/s/iol/19.jpg"><img src="/s/iol/19.jpg" alt=""></a><a href="/s/iol/20.jpg"><img src="/s/iol/20.jpg" alt=""></a><a href="/s/iol/21.jpg"><img src="/s/iol/21.jpg" alt=""></a><a href="/s/iol/22.jpg"><img src="/s/iol/22.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
            
            <p>On a tangentially related note, we happened to pass this wonderfully-named
            street on the way there:</p>
            
            <p><a href="/s/iol/23.jpg"><img src="/s/iol/23.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
            
            <p>The atmosphere of our group as we reached the bridge was what I can only
            describe as... wonder, awe, and even almost a sort of reverence. There was such
            a sense of giddy excitement that we had finally actually done it, only
            compounded by the indifferent and slightly confused locals (one of whom advised
            us &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be standing there&quot; in a heavy Irish accent as we took pictures
            on top of the bridge). It&#39;s funny how so many people probably walk past that
            bridge almost every day and don&#39;t give a second thought to the significance
            that it had to us. While we were there and all throughout the bus ride back and
            as we walked back to our dorms, we were left spontaneously giggling at the
            sheer reality of the situation.</p>
            
            <p>Anyway, back to the actual IOL stuff! I&#39;m actually going out of chronological
            order here, since this happened at the end of the first official day of the IOL
            and the opening ceremony. It was fantastic; there were some very talented
            singers and dancers who performed there, we listened to some speeches, and all
            the countries were welcomed individually (by means of slowly revealing facts
            about their country in relation to Ireland, then their skyline, and finally
            their flag until they realized that it was them and stood up, which took longer
            for some countries than it did others).</p>
            
            <p>The IOL jury also introduced themselves, and distinguished member Ivan
            Derzhanski graced us mere mortals with his—as I have come to understand
            traditional and famously hilarious—presentation on the IOL rules. I&#39;ll leave it
            at that, since it&#39;s impossible to do justice to his amazing deadpan delivery
            via text. And as the opening ceremony ended, I finally met team Australia, one
            of whose members had reminded me of the quaternion bridge in the first place.</p>
            
            <p>I went to sleep almost immediately after getting back from the trip to the
            bridge in anticipation of the individual contest the next day, for which we had
            all been preparing for so long. I think it&#39;s around here that it began to sink
            in that I was actually in Dublin, at the IOL, about to be one of the first few
            hundred people to see the test. As the bridge crew of 5 joked, though, we had
            Hamilton&#39;s blessing on our side. (At one point a bus had passed by our stop
            without seeming to even notice us; the bus was probably full, but the way we
            chose to interpret it was that the pure math radiating from all of us was
            simply too much for the driver.)</p>
            
            <p>And then it was time. After eating breakfast the next morning, we went straight
            to our designated rooms for taking the individual test. As we waited for the
            start of the 6-hour period assigned to complete the 5 problems, those of us on
            the USA and Canada teams who were in the same room looked around at each other
            in ways that probably tried to be reassuring but inevitably ended up as nervous
            smiles. At exactly 9:00, we opened our booklets and began!</p>
            
            <p>I don&#39;t have much to say about the contest itself, because spoilers. I&#39;ll go
            through the problems briefly, though. #1 was a number system problem in Birom,
            #2 was a metaphor-type problem in Abui, #3 was Kimbundu translation, #4 was
            translating Laven and deciphering its Khom orthography, and #5 was Madak
            morphology.</p>
            
            <p>I was actually pretty surprised that I solved #1 fully (although it was the
            last one I solved); usually, number problems are my weak point. I had gotten to
            a point where there were 4 possibilities for a digit if my assumptions up to
            there had been accurate, and none of the first three worked. That feeling when
            the fourth one caused everything to fall perfectly into place was so
            satisfying, though.</p>
            
            <p>The second problem was almost universally considered the hardest. Nobody I&#39;d
            talked to afterwards said they completely solved it, and many of them said they
            got all the other four. I didn&#39;t figure much out at all, but at the end I wrote
            down some dumb stuff that hopefully would give me a few points. (One of the
            coaches saw my paper as I walked out and said the first match she saw,
            &quot;father&#39;s pistol,&quot; was correct, so who knows.)</p>
            
            <p>3 and 4 were mostly straight translation, which is what I&#39;m best at, so I
            didn&#39;t find those too awful. Well, I take that back. #4 was solid proof that
            the IOL jury operates on a purely sadistic desire to torture the competitors.
            Ever wondered how to write &quot;seven pineapples&quot; in Laven (<em>plaj hnat pʌh plaj</em>)
            with the Khom orthography? Well, it&#39;s this:</p>
            
            <p><img src='/s/iol/24.jpg' style='width:100%'></p>
            
            <p>(sorry for the awful quality), and we had to draw out about 50 of those symbols
            in the process of writing up an explanation and answer to the problem. Yeah, I
            was very glad when I had finished with that one.</p>
            
            <p>I thought I had done okay on the fifth problem (although my writeup was the
            sketchiest out of 1, 3, 4, and 5). As it turned out, I missed a key element of
            the language and instead analyzed it by splitting the nouns into two classes,
            which was a stupid and worse way of achieving basically the same result. So
            I&#39;ll definitely lose some points for that, but hopefully it doesn&#39;t hurt me too
            much.</p>
            
            <p>After dinner I went to a talk on machine learning that a professor had prepared
            for us, which was enjoyable. And now I&#39;m sitting here writing this blog post,
            eagerly awaiting tomorrow (the IOL excursion!), Thursday (team contest! maybe I
            get to redeem myself from today!), and Friday (solution discussion, when they
            get to make us all feel like idiots!).</p>
            
            <p>Oh, and of course team Australia and I have been hard at work on some <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iolmemes/">shiny
            new IOL memes</a>. Can&#39;t forget that crucially
            important component of the IOL experience.</p>
