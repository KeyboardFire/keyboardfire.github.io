                <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/cfractal'>cfractal</a></strong> is a program I wrote for <a href='https://codeday.org/'>CodeDay</a> Houston in winter of 2015 with <a href='https://github.com/0e4ef622/'>one of my friends</a>. It won one of the four awards given out at the end of the event. cfractal generates beautiful <a href='http://flam3.com/flame.pdf'>fractal flames</a>; here's one of my favorites:<br><br><img src='fractal.png' alt='Fractal flame' width='100%'></li>
                <li id='phondue'><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/phondue'>phondue</a></strong> is a tool used to enter <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet'>International Phonetic Alphabet</a> symbols via a chart and digraphs (ex. <code>TH</code> automatically becomes <code>Î¸</code>), since I wasn't satisfied with the existing tools. The folks on <a href='https://redd.it/4h1jns'>/r/linguistics</a> and <a href='https://redd.it/4fzmqy'>/r/conlangs</a> found it useful, and in fact I use it regularly myself.</li>
                <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/caveman-duels'>caveman-duels</a></strong> was written for <a href='http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/34968/3808'>a King of the Hill programming contest on Stack Exchange</a>, which had over 50 participants. Aside from having fun, I learned a lot about C++ from writing it!</li>
                <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/snowman-lang'>snowman</a></strong> is an <a href='http://esolangs.org'>esoteric programming language</a>. Again, it was both fun to work on and taught me many things about C++. Here's an example Snowman program (it does ROT13 on its input):

                Needless to say, readability was not a primary design goal. (In fact, being as confusing and unreadable as possible was a major objective.)</li>

                <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/i3bang'>i3bang</a></strong> is a preprocessor for i3 config files, which are traditionally very verbose and repetitive (in an attempt to remain both flexible and easy to understand). I wrote i3bang with the goal of preserving those qualities while cutting down on some of the cruft, and I and several others have found it helpful (airblader himself called it "insanely cool," which I'm pretty proud of :)).</li>

                <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/kfp'>kfp</a></strong> is what this website runs on. It was the topic of <a href='/blog/code/on-the-merits-of-roll-your-own-blog-engine.html'>my first blog post</a>.</li>
                <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/rustyham'>rustyham</a></strong> is a Hamming code generator in Rust. I wrote rustyham primarily to see what it's like to work with a project complete with tests with Travis CI integration, put on a package manager, etc., but it's also (AFAIK) the first Hamming code program to be <a href='https://crates.io/crates/rustyham'>published on crates.io</a>, where it has &gt;300 downloads.</li>

                <li><strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/mkcast'>mkcast</a></strong> is a tool for creating GIF screencats of a terminal, with key presses overlaid. It got posted on Reddit and Hacker News and ended up getting over 3,300 stars on GitHub. But it's basically held together by terrible hacks, so I later made <strong><a href='https://github.com/KeyboardFire/xscast'>xscast</a></strong> which does the same thing but far better.</li>
